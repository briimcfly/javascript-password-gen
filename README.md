# Javscript Password Generator
## User Story
`AS AN` employee with access to sensitive data <br>
`I WANT` to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria <br>
`SO THAT` I can create a strong password that provides greater security <br>

## Acceptance Criteria
`GIVEN` I need a new, secure password <br>
`WHEN` I click the button to generate a password<br>
`THEN` I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria<br>
`WHEN` prompted for password criteria<br>
`THEN` I select which criteria to include in the password<br>
`WHEN` prompted for the length of the password<br>
`THEN` I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters<br>
`WHEN` asked for character types to include in the password<br>
`THEN` I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters<br>
`WHEN` I answer each prompt<br>
`THEN` my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected<br>
`WHEN` all prompts are answered<br>
`THEN` a password is generated that matches the selected criteria<br>
`WHEN` the password is generated<br>
`THEN` the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page<br>

## Reflection 
This project has allowed me to apply the core skills I have recently learned and put them into practice. During development, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of functions, DOM (Document Object Model) methods, and loops. Additionally, I developed a deeper appreciation for for the importance code commenting, and the development principal DRY. (Don't repeat yourself).
