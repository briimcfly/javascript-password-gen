`THEN` I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria<br>
`WHEN` prompted for password criteria<br>
`THEN` I select which criteria to include in the password<br>
`WHEN` prompted for the length of the password<br>

## Reflection 
This project has allowed me to apply the core skills I have recently learned and put them into practice. During development, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of functions, DOM (Document Object Model) methods, and loops. Additionally, I developed a deeper appreciation for for the importance code commenting, and the development principal DRY. (Don't repeat yourself).
